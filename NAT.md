======

## Build Goal (Working Rules)
   1. The purpose of this document is as follows:
      * Provide a NAT interface machines can connect to hidden behind PVE.
   2. Don't do *anything* or make changes if not *explicitly* required by the overall goal.

## Install Actions
   1. There is a [howto](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#sysadmin_network_configuration) on setting up
      a Masquerading (NAT) with IP Tables.
