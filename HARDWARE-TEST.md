Purpose
======

It has been the experience of those hopeful of using "[enterprise](https://www.ablison.com/what-does-enterprise-level-mean/)
level" Open Source Software on a home/ small office budget while using "RAID" technology that the promise of
recovery from a hardware failure is great, but when the hardware actually fails, recovery simply
doesn't work.

If you are considering the [BigRig Scripts](https://github.com/Romaq/bigrig-scripts/) project as a template
for setting up your own home or small office, I strongly suggest you consider testing your equipment for
backup recovery in the event of hardware failure. As my boss once told me, "Spit into one hand and *shhh-ould*
into the other, and see which of your hands fills faster." That zfs drive recovery "should" work simply isn't
good enough. Prove it does.
