Outline of build for the FILESERVER host
======

## Build Goal (Working Rules)
   1. The purpose of this machine is as follows:
      * Serve files as per [ORGANIZATION.md](../master/ORGANIZATION.md).
      * Manually maintain a relatively small list of client hosts and client users.
   2. Don't do *anything* or make changes if not *explicitly* required by the overall goal.

## Todo
   1. I am amiss in not doing a snapshot of the fileserver host before configuring and verifying the rollback process.
   2. I need to set up automated snapshots vs. recovery as part of this build.

## Install Actions
   1. This [howto](https://www.naturalborncoder.com/linux/proxmox/2023/07/06/building-a-nas-using-proxmox-part-1/) forms the basis
      of the following instructions.
	  
   2. From [Organization.md](../main/ORGANIZATION.md) we have the following structure for consideration:
      * asmith:asmith, users
	  * mikaela:mikaela, users
	  * gameserver, gameserver
	  * whimpercraft, gameserver
	  * palworld, gameserver
	  * valheim, gameserver
	  * asa, gameserver
	  At this time, I am not planning for "system" hosts to share data, but the means to do so would be obvious from the
	  gameservers listed and grouped as appropriate.
   
   
   3. Download the [fileserver LXC](https://www.turnkeylinux.org/files/tmp/debian-12-turnkey-fileserver_18.0rc2-1_amd64.tar.gz),
      but be aware this link is a Release Candidate at this time courtesy of [JedMeister](https://github.com/JedMeister).
   4. The file downloaded should be moved to /tank/vz/template/cache for use by PVE.
   5. Create the LXC for `filesystem` with the default settings except use 2 cores. In the following instructions, it is presumed
      this is created as "CT 101." If you used a different number, be mindful to change the value accordingly.
   6. Create the following zfs datasets on PVE.
      * `zfs create -p tank/fileserver/tub` for host specific use, including host "internal" backups. Becomes `/tank` on the client.
	  * `chmod 777 /tank/fileserver/tub` for the initial setup of permissions. This will be corrected later.
      * `zfs create -p tank/fileserver/home` as a `home` folder for client users on the network.
	  * `chmod 777 /tank/fileserver/home`
      * `zfs create -p tank/fileserver/share` for files to be shared amount the network users and/ or host clients.
	  * `chmod 777 /tank/fileserver/share`
	  * `#zfs create -p rpool/fileserver/share` is *not* created as this time, but may be useful if "fast" sharing is required. The
	    amount of space for this purpose would be significantly smaller, and is considered an edge use case at this time.
   5. Use the following commands to link the created zfs filesystem to the fileserver from the PVE command line[^1]:
      ```
	  pct set 101 -mp0 /tank/fileserver/tub,mp=/tank
	  pct set 101 -mp0 /tank/fileserver/home,mp=/home
	  pct set 101 -mp0 /tank/fileserver/share,mp=/share
	  ```
   6. Start the server and have a password ready for the "root samba account." This password is *not* the same as the host
      root account!
   7. Enter your email, of course, and note the IP of various services before you close the window. Be sure to add
      `fileserver` as a new host in the `dns` local domain list.
   8. Use your browser to connect to the [GUI](http://fileserver:12321).
   9. We will now prepare the offered Samba shares. Go to the [Samba configuration](https://fileserver:12321/samba/?xnavigation=1)
   10. Select `cdrom` and `Delete Selected Shares`.
   11. The "homes" sharing will actually be split between "tub" for host only and "home" for user only when added as functional
       "users" and attached as SMB clients. The "share" the only folder specific for managed sharing between multiple hosts and
	   users depending upon need and policy. So the "homes" share we will leave as is.
   12. Select `storage` and the configuration page will appear.
   13. Rename `storage` to `share`, and change the "Directory to share" to `/share`, then `Save`.
   14. Add System users and groups through https://fileserver:12321/useradmin/?xnavigation=1. For example, let's create the username
       "bob" by selecting the `Create a new user` button.
   15. Enter "bob" for the username and give it a password which will match the SMB password in later steps. For the "Home
       directory," allow it to use "Automatic" which will default to `/home`.
   16. For the "Primary Group," select "New group with same name as user" and add "users" as the Seconary Group. Be sure to select
       the "right arrow" button to move this to the "In groups" panel.
   17. The defaults should be fine, but the ideal policy is, "don't add or change anything you do not *have* to." Permissions should
       be planned such that "users" group projects, "client" machine projects and such can be protected at this level.
   18. Add a new "host client" much the same way. For this example, we will have a machine named "ASA". Follow step #14, but we will
       use a specific "home" for each client. This is to separate "user" data from "machine data that likely needs scheduled
	   backup." So for the "Home directory" use `/tank/asa`. This folder is the "home" for the `/tank` shared with other
	   machines.[^2]
   19. While this particular host has no other logical groups at this time, you may wish to add such logical groups as needed. In
       this case, it is "gameuser" making the backups and handling the data. On another, it could be "www-data" if it is your web
	   server, and so on. It is the job of the fileserver host and the SMB client to correctly map the UID of the client to the UID
	   of the host.[^3]
	   
	   *** Howto doesn't mention "how to" mount the SMB, it just does everything else interactively... SO ***
	   
   22. Working from another [howto](https://linuxtect.com/linux-smbclient-command-tutorial/), I need to `apt install smbclient`.
   23. `smbclient -L fileserver.local` will ask for your `WORKGROUP\root` password. Go ahead and use your "root@fileserver'
       password to see the list.[^4]
   24. `smbclient -L \\fileserver\asa` will be used to confirm it works for the "asa" user, and we will mount that on the ASA client
       `/tank` for off-host saving our game backups.
   
   
	   
	   
	   
   
   9. In the web GUI, select `Networking/NFS Exports`, `Select all` and delete the existing exports unless you are comfortable
      setting up NFS securely. For the purpose of this network, we will be using SMB4 clients all the way for consistant
      behavior and security policy.
   10. The Unix "home" directories for users need to be on the "tank". I recommend using the webmin GUI interface to interact
       with the server, or setting up alternate accounts separate from the accounts and groups mentioned here. Seriously,
       just use webmin at port 12321.
   11. Select `System/Users and Groups`, `Create a new user`, then add yourself. I suggest "new group with the same name as
       user" and a secondary group of "users". Be sure to set the "Home Directory" to `/tank/homes`. Have it set a new group
       with the same name as the user, then add group "users" as a secondary group. Create.
   13. Next, select `Servers/Samba Windows File Sharing`, `Samba Groups`, then add Unix group "users" as Samba group "users".
       Describe them as "Client users on the network."
   14. `Servers/Samba Windows File Sharing`, `Convert Users`, then select from `Only listed users` for the users in your
       network. "Convert Users" to have them added.
   15. `Servers/Samba Windows File Sharing`, `Create File Share`, then select a share name of "Home Directories Share",
       `/tank/home` is the directory to share, "create with permissions: 750", "Create with group: users",

## Footnotes:
   [^1]: Using the PVE GUI interface creates a more complicated directory structure. Using CLI is direct and keeps
       the directory structure on PVE more simplified.
   [^2]: When we schedule backups from the fileserver, we will do backups out of its `/tank` which will encompass the `/tank`
       folder mounted on the other machines. As we plan on backups to be handled by the fileserver, we are going to ignore the
	   UID/GUID and mapping on the PVE host as identity and permissions are maintained *there*. But this will show on the PVE host
	   as `/tank/fileserver/tub/asa` with raw UID/GUIDs of 100000+. Those *can* be mapped to identities, but that would be extra
	   work for minimal benefit in this application. For an "enterprise class" build, you would likely use OpenLDAP, but you would
	   also be paying someone for their time and expertise. You *do* get what you pay for.
   [^3]: You may also need to use "set sticky guid" and set other Linux file-system permissions. If you are reading this, you should
       know what you are doing. There are a number of valuable places to [start](https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/).
   [^4]: I have "fileserver" as a cname for "fileserver.local", but smbclient won't look up by cname. I beg the indulgance of
       forgiveness as I learn by doing.
