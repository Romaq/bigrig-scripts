Outline of build for the GOTIFY host
======

## Build Goal (Working Rules)
   1. The purpose of this machine is as follows:
      This container is already purpose created by [Kingneutron](https://github.com/kneutron) and should have
      no other attachments or changes beyond configuration.
   2. Don't do *anything* or make changes if not *explicitly* required by the overall goal.
## Install
   1. Per a discussion of
      [Gotify Notifications on Proxmox](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/gotify-notifications-lxc-instead-of-docker.142333/),
      there is a video on how to install an LXC container.
