### Purpose

These notes have "shorthand" for navigation menus. To avoid confusion, consider the following graphic:

[Click here to embiggen!](../main/PVE-Legend.png "PVE Screen")

When the purpose is to navigate to the "Options" button on the example screen, you need to select the
"Datacenter", then "PVE", lastly "100 (dns)" of the left panel. This is more easily abbreviated as
`Datacenter/PVE/dns` in the format so it stands out a bit more clearly. For a selection you need on
the right, such as the "Summary", a colon will be used so it will appear as follows:
`Datacenter/pve/dns:Summary`. If the intent was to have you select a specific button, that button will
be identified separately as follows through the navigation tree: `Datacenter/PVE/dns` ">_ Console".

This "shorthand" developed in the course of developing this document. Corrections (or other ideas on
how to do this better) are invited.

Also note, a particular container by name such as "dns" is preferred to "100 (dns)". That numberic
number may differ depending on the order created.
