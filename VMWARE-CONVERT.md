 Outline of build for the DNS host

## Document Goal (Working Rules)
   1. The purpose of this document is as follows:  
      Take an already functional VMWare image and turn it into a functional Proxmox VM.
   2. The intent is more "how I did it" rather than "repeat what the
      [howto](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Migrate_to_Proxmox_VE#Migration) already explains "how to" do it.

## Peparation Actions and Presumptions
   1. It is presumed you have a VMWare image you wish to bring into Proxmox, which would be the point of reading this document.
   2. As per the [howto](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Migrate_to_Proxmox_VE#Preparation) guide, be sure to remove the VMWare "guest"
      tools before attempting further steps.
   3. Keep a note of what MAC and IP you are expecting your VM to maintain during the move to avoid service disruption.
